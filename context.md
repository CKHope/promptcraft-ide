# PromptCraft IDE Development Context

This document outlines the development process, current status of Functional Requirements (FRs), and main discussion points for the PromptCraft IDE project.

## I. Development Phases & Overall Status

The project started with implementing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focused on a local-first, offline-capable Progressive Web App (PWA) for prompt management. After completing the MVP, development moved to implementing Advanced Feature Specifications (AFRs) to transform the application into a more comprehensive Prompt Engineering IDE. The AFR phase is now concluded.

**Previous Phases:**
*   MVP Implementation - **CONCLUDED**
*   Advanced Feature Specifications (AFRs) Implementation - **CONCLUDED**

**Current Phase:** Feature Refinement & Visual Chaining Implementation - **IN PROGRESS**

## III. Main Discussion Points & Decisions (Previous Phases)

1.  **Technology Stack:** React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, IndexedDB, Service Worker, `@google/genai`, `diff` library.
2.  **API Key Management Security (AFR-3.1):** Upgraded to AES-GCM encryption.
3.  **Prompt Chaining (AFR-1.2 - Non-Visual):** The simplified, non-visual implementation using `{{promptOutput:ID}}` was completed. The visual interface aspect was deferred to a later phase, now being addressed.
4.  **Backend Integration Deferred:** Decision made to postpone User Accounts (FR-6) and Cloud Sync (FR-7) until after all local PWA features are fully refined. This ensures schema stability and focuses on immediate PWA value.

## IV. Current Phase Plan: "Feature Refinement & Visual Chaining Implementation"

### A. Strategic Direction for This Phase

*   Complete all planned user-facing features within the PWA, focusing on delivering a polished and comprehensive local-first experience.
*   Implement the visual interface for prompt chaining, enhancing the core "Prompt Engineering IDE" capabilities.
*   Conduct a thorough review of all existing features for UI/UX improvements, bug fixes, and overall polish.

### B. Key Functional Requirements for This Phase

1.  **Implement Visual Interface for Prompt Chaining (AFR-1.2 - Visual Part)**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:green;">✔</span> **Implemented & Verified**
    *   **BRD Reference:** Section 2.3 (AFR-1.2)
    *   **Description:** Develop a user-friendly visual interface that assists users in constructing prompt chains. This UI will help users select prompts and understand the flow, ultimately aiding in the generation/insertion of the `{{promptOutput:ID}}` syntax into a prompt's content.
    *   **Detailed Behavior & UI:**
        *   **Trigger:** A button/icon within the `PromptEditor` (e.g., next to the content textarea) labeled "Build/Insert Chain" or similar.
        *   **Modal (`VisualChainBuilderModal`):**
            *   Opens when the trigger is clicked.
            *   Receives current prompt content and a callback to update this content.
            *   **Chain Steps Area:** Displays an ordered list of prompts (steps) added by the user. Allows drag-and-drop reordering, adding (via searchable prompt list), and removing steps.
            *   **Content Editor Preview Area:** A textarea for users to type connecting text around placeholders.
            *   **Insertion Helper:** A button like "Insert Output of Selected Step at Cursor" inserts `{{promptOutput:ID_OF_SELECTED_PROMPT_IN_CHAIN_STEPS}}` at the cursor in the preview area.
            *   **Action Buttons:** "Apply to Prompt Editor" (updates main editor content, closes modal) and "Cancel".
    *   **Visual Appearance:** Clean modal interface with clear distinctions for chain steps and content construction. Intuitive controls with visual feedback for drag-and-drop.

2.  **Comprehensive Feature Review & Polish**
    *   **Status:** <span style="color:orange;">⚪</span> **Pending**
    *   **Description:** Systematically review all existing MVP and AFR features.
    *   **Areas of Focus:**
        *   UI/UX Consistency (design patterns, styles, modal behaviors).
        *   Responsiveness (usability across screen sizes).
        *   Accessibility (A11y - ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
        *   Error Handling (user-friendly messages, graceful failures).
        *   Performance (address noticeable sluggishness).
        *   Bug Fixes.
    *   **Output:** A list of small improvements and fixes to be implemented.

### C. Rationale for This Phase's Scope

*   **Completes Core Functionality:** The visual chain builder is the last major *new* piece of prompt engineering functionality outlined in the AFRs.
*   **Enhances User Experience:** A dedicated review and polish cycle will significantly improve the overall quality and usability.
*   **Solid Foundation:** Ensures the local-first PWA is robust and feature-complete before considering larger architectural changes.

### D. Preliminary Test Plan Outline for This Phase

1.  **Visual Prompt Chaining (AFR-1.2 - Visual Part):**
    *   Modal opening/closing.
    *   Adding, reordering (drag-and-drop), and removing prompts in chain steps.
    *   Correct insertion of `{{promptOutput:ID}}`.
    *   "Apply to Prompt Editor" functionality.
    *   Usability and intuitiveness.
    *   Edge cases.
2.  **Existing Feature Regression Testing:**
    *   Full manual regression test suite for all MVP and implemented AFR features.
3.  **UI/UX Polish Validation:**
    *   Verify all implemented UI/UX improvements from the review step.
