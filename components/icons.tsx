// All icon components are now located in constants.tsx
// This file is kept to align with the thought process of component organization,
// but for this project, combining icons with other constants in constants.tsx was chosen
// due to the potential for constants.tsx to contain JSX (like these icons).

// Example of how one might re-export if needed, though direct import from constants.tsx is preferred.
// export { SparklesIcon, PlusIcon, TagIcon } from '../constants';

import React from 'react';

// You can define or re-export icons here if you prefer a dedicated file.
// For this project, they are in constants.tsx. This file can be removed or used later.
